# MVC-PHP
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in PHP is a widely used architecture for developing web applications. It separates an application into three interconnected components, promoting code organization and reusability.

# Components of MVC

1. Model:
Represents the data and business logic of the application.
Handles data fetching, manipulation, and storage (e.g., database interactions).
Independent of the user interface.

2. View:

Displays data to the user.
It receives data from the Controller (often via the Model) and presents it in a structured format (e.g., HTML, JSON).

3. Controller:

Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.
Acts as the glue between the Model and the View.
